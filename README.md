# Open Social Compact - Template Repository

This repository is designed as a starting point for digital communities to establish a "citizenship model" tailored to their particular needs and contexts.

## What problem are we trying to solve?
A code of conduct makes a community's norms and values explicit and enforceable. Governance makes decision-making within a community explicit and accountable. A license makes the conditions of adoption and reuse of the community's work explicit and legally binding.

What's missing is "connective tissue" bringing norms, governance, adoptions, and use together into a cohesive whole, supported by a robust ethical framework that promotes just, equitable, and pro-social outcomes in the work of our open source communities.

## About the Open Social Compact
The Open Social Compact lets communities define the fundamental rights of all their participants; the specific responsibilities that participants have toward the community; and the privileges that are extended to participants who respect these rights and meet these responsibilities.

The Open Social Compact will also provide an innovative model for centering and elevating the safety and well-being not only of maintainers, collaborators, adopters, and users, but– most importantly– the safety and well-being of those who are most impacted by technologies we create, whether explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly, consensually or coercively.

## About the Organization for Ethical Source
We are a global community of open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, legal experts, academics, sociologists, human rights workers, and others who work together on ways to center justice and equity in the software commons.

OES stewards the continuing development of [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org) and developed the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev), both examples of innovative policy instruments specifically designed to meet the evolving needs of open source communities.
