# Priority of Constituencies

When ethical conflicts arise, or when the exercise or protection of Rights raises issues, in seeking resolution we will act in the interest of the safety and well-being of the least advantaged over the most advantaged:

* Non-consensual users, over
* End users, over
* Community well-being, over
* Adopters, over
* Community leaders, over
* Philosophical, theoretical, or technical purity.
